<h1>GoHoney</h1><h4>By Noche</h4>

<p>GoHoney..well everyone is going to be thirsty for Free Wifi when they
are out of service or in a coffee shop right. Yet no one will notice when
someone creates a rogue wifi network. If you know most Free Wifi have you 
enter your email or some sort of credentials and make you either confirm that 
you won't do anything malicious or just have it prompted in when you sign in. Others 
will just have you enter the wifi credentials which would be the password.</p>
<p>Today is the day I learn about honey pots and how they function. This is all
for fun and curiousity</p>

<h3>Goals:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Learn how to create a HoneyPot</li>
  <li>Create a Fake Web Login Page</li>
  <li>Rick Roll people on this honeypot</li>
  <li>View traffic on wireshark</li>
</ol>


Day 1:

  For today I learned how to setup a simple web server using golang. Now the goal is to learn 
  more about golang net/http library to be able to build more on top of a basic web server for GoHoney.
  The next thing would be to learn how to gather intel on devices that connect to the wifi pineapple or
  output basic information on my terminal. Their is another curious idea in my mind which is to to 
  some how redirect users into a simple login which will make them login to either a google email,
  yahoo email etc..One more thing I was working on was learning more about the wifi pineapple. 

  The question in the air is what type of honey pot do I want to make?
