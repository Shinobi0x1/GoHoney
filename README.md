<h1>GoHoney</h1><h4>By Noche</h4>

<p>GoHoney..well everyone is going to be thirsty for Free Wifi when they
are out of service or in a coffee shop right. Yet no one will notice when
someone creates a rogue wifi network. If you know most Free Wifi have you 
enter your email or some sort of credentials and make you either confirm that 
you won't do anything malicious or just have it prompted in when you sign in. Others 
will just have you enter the wifi credentials which would be the password.</p>

for fun and curiousity</p>
